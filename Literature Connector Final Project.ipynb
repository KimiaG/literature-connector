Coldly afflicted, My feet were by frost benumbed.\\n\\nChill its chains are; chafing sighs\\n\\nHew my heart round and hunger begot\\n\\nMere-weary mood. Lest man know not\\n\\nThat he on dry land loveliest liveth,\\n\\nList how I, care-wretched, on ice-cold sea, Weathered the winter, wretched outcast\\n\\nDeprived of my kinsmen;\\n\\nHung with hard ice-flakes, where hail-scur flew, There I heard naught save the harsh sea And ice-cold wave, at whiles the swan cries, Did for my games the gannet’s clamour,\\n\\nSea-fowls, loudness was for me laughter, The mews’ singing all my mead-drink.\\n\\nStorms, on the stone-cliffs beaten, fell on the stern In icy feathers; full oft the eagle screamed With spray on his pinion.\\n\\nNot any protector\\n\\nMay make merry man faring needy.\\n\\nThis he little believes, who aye in winsome life Abides ‘mid burghers some heavy business, Wealthy and wine-flushed, how I weary oft Must bide above brine.\\n\\nNeareth nightshade, snoweth from north, Frost froze the land, hail fell on earth then Corn of the coldest. Nathless there knocketh now The heart’s thought that I on high streams The salt-wavy tumult traverse alone.\\n\\nMoaneth alway my mind’s lust\\n\\nThat I fare forth, that I afar hence\\n\\nSeek out a foreign fastness.\\n\\nFor this there’s no mood-lofty man over earth’s midst, Not though he be given his good, but will have in his youth greed; Nor his deed to the daring, nor his king to the faithful But shall have his sorrow for sea-fare\\n\\nWhatever his lord will.\\n\\nHe hath not heart for harping, nor in ring-having Nor winsomeness to wife, nor world’s delight Nor any whit else save the wave’s slash, Yet longing comes upon him to fare forth on the water.\\n\\nBosque taketh blossom, cometh beauty of berries, Fields to fairness, land fares brisker,\\n\\n\\n\\nAll this admonisheth man eager of mood, The heart turns to travel so that he then thinks On flood-ways to be far departing.\\n\\nCuckoo calleth with gloomy crying,\\n\\nHe singeth summerward, bodeth sorrow,\\n\\nThe bitter heart’s blood. Burgher knows not —\\n\\nHe the prosperous man — what some perform Where wandering them widest draweth.\\n\\nSo that but now my heart burst from my breast-lock, My mood ‘mid the mere-flood,\\n\\nOver the whale’s acre, would wander wide.\\n\\nOn earth’s shelter cometh oft to me,\\n\\nEager and ready, the crying lone-flyer, Whets for the whale-path the heart irresistibly, O’er tracks of ocean; seeing that anyhow My lord deems to me this dead life\\n\\nOn loan and on land, I believe not\\n\\nThat any earth-weal eternal standeth\\n\\nSave there be somewhat calamitous\\n\\nThat, ere a man’s tide go, turn it to twain.\\n\\nDisease or oldness or sword-hate\\n\\nBeats out the breath from doom-gripped body.\\n\\nAnd for this, every earl whatever, for those speaking after —\\n\\nLaud of the living, boasteth some last word, That he will work ere he pass onward,\\n\\nFrame on the fair earth ‘gainst foes his malice, Daring ado, …\\n\\nSo that all men shall honour him after\\n\\nAnd his laud beyond them remain ‘mid the English, Aye, for ever, a lasting life’s-blast,\\n\\nDelight mid the doughty.\\n\\nDays little durable,\\n\\nAnd all arrogance of earthen riches,\\n\\nThere come now no kings nor Cćsars\\n\\nNor gold-giving lords like those gone.\\n\\nHowe’er in mirth most magnified,\\n\\nWhoe’er lived in life most lordliest,\\n\\nDrear all this excellence, delights undurable!\\n\\nWaneth the watch, but the world holdeth.\\n\\nTomb hideth trouble. The blade is layed low.\\n\\nEarthly glory ageth and seareth.\\n\\nNo man at all going the earth’s gait,\\n\\nBut age fares against him, his face paleth, Grey-haired he groaneth, knows gone companions, Lordly men are to earth o’ergiven,\\n\\nNor may he then the flesh-cover, whose life ceaseth, Nor eat the sweet nor feel the sorry,\\n\\nNor stir hand nor think in mid heart,\\n\\nAnd though he strew the grave with gold, His born brothers, their buried bodies\\n\\nBe an unlikely treasure hoard.',\n",
